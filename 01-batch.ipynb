Chi-Quadrat-Tests für die Unabhängigkeit ergaben, dass es keine signifikanten Unterschiede im Geschlecht der Teilnehmer je nach Bedingung gab und keine signifikanten Unterschiede in den Studienfächern der Teilnehmer je nach Bedingung. Es gab auch keine signifikanten Unterschiede in der Anzahl der Personen, die sie kannten und die ADHS hatten, zwischen den drei Bedingungen. Im Durchschnitt beantworteten die Teilnehmer 90 % der Fragen, die ihr Verständnis der Textpassagen beurteilten, richtig, und es gab keine signifikanten Gruppenunterschiede. Diese Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass die zufällige Zuordnung der Teilnehmer zu den verschiedenen Bedingungen wie geplant funktioniert hat. Die Daten wurden auch auf Schiefe (<|3,0|) und Wölbung (<|10,0|; Weston & Gore, 2006) geprüft. Die absoluten Werte der standardisierten Residuen erfüllten diese Kriterien, so dass keine Ausreißer gefunden wurden. Boxplots für alle abhängigen Variablen zeigten, dass es keine Ausreißer gab. Es gab auch keine multivariaten Ausreißer, da die Mahalanobis-Distanzen nicht signifikant waren.

      "In einer Studie untersuchen Ching und Ma (2021) den Einfluss von Erklärungen zum Ursprung der Aufmerksamkeits-Defizit-Hyperaktivitäts-Störung, kurz ADHS, auf die Stigmatisierung der Störung. ADHS ist eine weit verbreitete Verhaltensstörung mit einer weltweiten Prävalenz von 5,29% (Polanczky et al., 2007). Die Störung ist durch Unaufmerksamkeit, Hyperaktivität und Impulsivität gekennzeichnet (American Psychiatric Association, 1994).\n",
      "Es können diverse Stigmatisierungen gegenüber Menschen mit ADHS festgestellt werden. ADHS-Diagnostizierte sind mit einer höheren Gefährlichkeit (Pescosolido et al., 2007) und einem geringeren Bildungserfolg assoziiert (Eisenberg & Schneider, 2007). Zudem besteht gegenüber der Gruppe eine soziale Unerwünschtheit (Canu et al., 2008). Auf Basis der Attributionstheorie stellt sich die Frage, ob durch die ursächliche Erklärung von ADHS das Stigma verringert werden kann? Welchen Einfluss hat das Framing von ADHS auf die Stigmatisierung? \n",
      "Die Attributionstheorie nimmt die wahrgenommene Kausalität, beispielsweise zwischen zwei Merkmalen, in den Blick (Weiner, 1995). Ein soziales Stigma meint eine negative Beurteilung gegenüber einem Individuum (Jones et al., 1984). Die Attributionstheorie untersucht den Ursprung sozialer Stigmata. Es wird geschaut, welche wahrgenommenen Kausalitäten gemäß der Attributionstheorie zu der Stigmatisierung führen. Das Stigma wird beispielsweise hinsichtlich der Kontrollierbarkeit untersucht. Wird ein Verhalten stigmatisiert, das als biologisch determiniert - also als wenig bis gar nicht kontrollierbar - wahrgenommen wird, kommt es zu einer geringeren Verurteilung (Corrigan, 2000). Andererseits stützt es die individuelle Wahrnehmung einer kategorischen Differenz zwischen sich und der stigmatisierten Person und festigt dadurch Stereotype (Dar-Nimrod & Heine, 2006; Haslam & Levy, 2006).\n",
      "In einer Meta-Analyse (Kvaale et. al., 2013) konnte herausgefunden werden, dass durch eine biologische Erklärung mentaler Krankheit die Personen weniger für ihre Problem verantwortlich gemacht werden, es aber die wahrgenommene Gefährlichkeit und Unberechenbarkeit und die Distanz zu den Personen erhöht und verstärkt davon ausgegangen wird, dass sich die mentale Störung nicht behandeln lässt. Das Stigma ist multidimensional, weshalb die biologische Erklärung in Bezug auf die verschiedenen Dimensionen unterschiedlich interpretiert wird. So kann die biologische Erklärung sowohl positive als auch negative Konsequenzen haben (Haslam & Kvaale, 2015).\n",
      "Das “stigma asymmetry model” kommt zu einem ähnlichen Ergebnis. Die biologische Erklärung, in diesem Fall von Übergewicht, kann sowohl negative Vorurteile abbauen, als auch gewisse Vorurteile stärken (Hoyt et al., 2017).\n",
      "Bei der Wirkung einer biologischen Erklärung auf die Wahrnehmung von ADHS konnte festgestellt werden, dass sich ein verstärkter Behandlungspessimus einstellte. Die Feststellung differenziert sich in zwei Befunde, zum einen wird der medikamentösen Behandlung eine größere Effektivität zugeschrieben, zum anderen reduziert sich die wahrgenommene Effektivität einer psychotherapeutischen Behandlung (Lebowitz et al., 2016). Außerdem reduziert sich der Wunsch nach sozialer Distanz, was damit in Verbindung gebracht werden kann, dass Menschen mit kognitiven Defiziten selten als bedrohlich und gefährlich stereotypisiert sind. Bei ADHS überwiegen vor allem Vorurteile in Bezug auf die eigene Verantwortlichkeit für die Probleme. Gerade diese Sichtweise wird durch die biologische Erklärung unterminiert, weshalb es ein effektiver Weg sein kann, durch die biologische Erklärung Vorurteile abzubauen (Sadler et al., 2012).\n",
      "Die Studie versucht zum einen den Zusammenhang von biologischer Attribution und ADHS-Stigma zu evaluieren. Darüber hinaus soll herausgefunden werden, welchen Einfluss ein spezielles Framing der biologischen Ursache auf die Stigmatisierung hat. Dafür wurden zwei fiktive Artikel entworfen. Ein Artikel verweist auf eine eindeutig biologische Ursache, der andere Artikel betont ein Zusammenspiel von biologischen und Umweltfaktoren, da vermutet wird, dass ein interaktionistischer Blick eine essentialistische Sichtweise untergräbt und dadurch das negative Stigma reduziert (Walker & Read, 2002). Insgesamt wird hypothetisch angenommen, dass der Artikel zum biologischen Determinismus die Stigmatisierung sowohl reduziert als auch steigert. Für den interaktionistischen Artikel wird hypothetisiert, dass die biologische Sichtweise die Beschuldigung gegenüber den betroffenen Personen reduziert und die Betonung der Umweltfaktoren den Behandlungsoptimismus stärkt (Ching & Ma, 2021).\n",

Nicht-erwachsene ADHS-Betroffene sehen sich im Vergleich zu Kindern ohne ADHS einer Reihe Stigmata ausgesetzt, wie z.B. geringerer sozialer Erwünschtheit (Canu et al., 2008), schlechtere Einschätzungen der schulischen Kompetenz durch Lehrkräfte oder der eigenen Eltern (Eisenberg & Schneider, 2007) .

      "Vor der Hypothesenprüfung wurden präexperimentelle Unterschiede in mehreren potenziellen Ko-Varianten zwischen den drei Bedingungen (d. h. biologisch-deterministische, interaktionistische und Kontrollgruppen) geprüft. Eine Varianzanalyse (ANOVA) zeigte, dass es keine signifikanten Unterschiede im Alter der Teilnehmer je nach Bedingung gab. Chi-Quadrat-Tests für die Unabhängigkeit ergaben, dass es keine signifikanten Unterschiede im Geschlecht der Teilnehmer je nach Bedingung gab und keine signifikanten Unterschiede in den Studienfächern der Teilnehmer je nach Bedingung. Es gab auch keine signifikanten Unterschiede in der Anzahl der Personen, die sie kannten und die ADHS hatten, zwischen den drei Bedingungen. Im Durchschnitt beantworteten die Teilnehmer 90 % der Fragen, die ihr Verständnis der Textpassagen beurteilten, richtig, und es gab keine signifikanten Gruppenunterschiede. Diese Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass die zufällige Zuordnung der Teilnehmer zu den verschiedenen Bedingungen wie geplant funktioniert hat. Die Daten wurden auch auf Schiefe (<|3,0|) und Wölbung (<|10,0|; Weston & Gore, 2006) geprüft. Die absoluten Werte der standardisierten Residuen erfüllten diese Kriterien, so dass keine Ausreißer gefunden wurden. Boxplots für alle abhängigen Variablen zeigten, dass es keine Ausreißer gab. Es gab auch keine multivariaten Ausreißer, da die Mahalanobis-Distanzen nicht signifikant waren. Sowohl der Box-Test auf Ko-Varianzgleichheit als auch der Levene-Test auf Fehlervarianzgleichheit waren nicht signifikant, was darauf schließen lässt, dass die für die ANOVA erforderlichen Annahmen der Homogenität der Kovarianzen und Varianzen nicht verletzt wurden. Auf der Grundlage dieser Ergebnisse haben wir die multivariaten und univarianten Varianzanalysen wie folgt durchgeführt.\n",

      "Wie erwartet zeigte sich ein signifikanter Haupteffekt der Kondition auf die Überzeugung, dass biologische Faktoren die Ursachen von ADHS sind. Die Teilnehmer der biologisch-deterministischen Bedingung stimmten biologischen Faktoren als Ursache von ADHS stärker zu als die Teilnehmer der interaktionistischen und der Kontrollbedingung, während die interaktionistische Gruppe höhere Werte als die Kontrollgruppe aufwies. Es gab auch einen signifikanten Haupteffekt der Bedingung auf die Überzeugung der Teilnehmer, dass Umweltfaktoren die Ursachen von ADHS sind. Die Teilnehmer der interaktionistischen Bedingung stimmten den Umweltfaktoren stärker zu als die Teilnehmer der biologisch-deterministischen und der Kontrollbedingung, während die biologisch-deterministische Gruppe niedrigere Werte als die Kontrollgruppe aufwies. Anschließend führte man eine multivariate Varianzanalyse (MANOVA) durch, um zu prüfen, ob es zwischen den drei Bedingungen allgemeine Unterschiede in den Werten für (a) den Wunsch nach sozialer Diskriminierung, (b) Schuldzuweisung und (c) Entitätsüberzeugungen gab. Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass es signifikante Unterschiede bei den abhängigen Variablen zwischen den Bedingungen gab. Nachfolgende Analysen zeigten signifikante Haupteffekte der Bedingung auf alle abhängigen Variablen mit großen Effektgrößen (Wunsch nach sozialer Distanz, Tadel, Entitäts-Überzeugungen. Diese signifikanten Unterschiede wurden mit Bonferroni-korrigierten Post-hoc-Tests überprüft. Beim Wunsch nach sozialer Distanz gab es keinen signifikanten Unterschied zwischen der biologisch-deterministischen Bedingung und der Kontrollgruppe, aber die Teilnehmer in der interaktionistischen Bedingung hatten signifikant niedrigere Werte als die Teilnehmer in den anderen beiden Bedingungen (d. h. biologisch-deterministisch=Kontrolle>interaktionistisch). Die Teilnehmer der biologisch-deterministischen und der interaktionistischen Bedingung wiesen ein geringeres Maß an Schuldzuweisungen auf als die Tei\n",

Interaktionist<biologisch-deterministisch<Kontrolle). Was den Glauben an die Entität betrifft, so hatten die Teilnehmer in der biologisch-deterministischen Bedingung höhere Werte als die anderen beiden Gruppen, während die Teilnehmer in der interaktionistischen Bedingung niedrigere Werte als die Kontrollgruppe aufwiesen (d. h. biologisch-deterministisch>Kontrolle>interaktionistisch).\n",

      "In einer Studie untersuchen Ching und Ma (2021) den Einfluss von Erklärungen zum Ursprung der Aufmerksamkeits-Defizit-Hyperaktivitäts-Störung, kurz ADHS, auf die Stigmatisierung der Störung. ADHS ist eine weit verbreitete Verhaltensstörung mit einer weltweiten Prävalenz von 5,29% (Polanczky et al., 2007). Die Störung ist durch Unaufmerksamkeit, Hyperaktivität und Impulsivität gekennzeichnet (American Psychiatric Association, 1994).\n",
      "Es können diverse Stigmatisierungen gegenüber Menschen mit ADHS festgestellt werden. ADHS-Diagnostizierte sind mit einer höheren Gefährlichkeit (Pescosolido et al., 2007) und einem geringeren Bildungserfolg assoziiert (Eisenberg & Schneider, 2007). Zudem besteht gegenüber der Gruppe eine soziale Unerwünschtheit (Canu et al., 2008). Auf Basis der Attributionstheorie stellt sich die Frage, ob durch die ursächliche Erklärung von ADHS das Stigma verringert werden kann? Welchen Einfluss hat das Framing von ADHS auf die Stigmatisierung? \n",
      "Die Attributionstheorie nimmt die wahrgenommene Kausalität, beispielsweise zwischen zwei Merkmalen, in den Blick (Weiner, 1995). Ein soziales Stigma meint eine negative Beurteilung gegenüber einem Individuum (Jones et al., 1984). Die Attributionstheorie untersucht den Ursprung sozialer Stigmata. Es wird geschaut, welche wahrgenommenen Kausalitäten gemäß der Attributionstheorie zu der Stigmatisierung führen. Das Stigma wird beispielsweise hinsichtlich der Kontrollierbarkeit untersucht. Wird ein Verhalten stigmatisiert, das als biologisch determiniert - also als wenig bis gar nicht kontrollierbar - wahrgenommen wird, kommt es zu einer geringeren Verurteilung (Corrigan, 2000). Andererseits stützt es die individuelle Wahrnehmung einer kategorischen Differenz zwischen sich und der stigmatisierten Person und festigt dadurch Stereotype (Dar-Nimrod & Heine, 2006; Haslam & Levy, 2006).\n",
      "In einer Meta-Analyse (Kvaale et. al., 2013) konnte herausgefunden werden, dass durch eine biologische Erklärung mentaler Krankheit die Personen weniger für ihre Problem verantwortlich gemacht werden, es aber die wahrgenommene Gefährlichkeit und Unberechenbarkeit und die Distanz zu den Personen erhöht und verstärkt davon ausgegangen wird, dass sich die mentale Störung nicht behandeln lässt. Das Stigma ist multidimensional, weshalb die biologische Erklärung in Bezug auf die verschiedenen Dimensionen unterschiedlich interpretiert wird. So kann die biologische Erklärung sowohl positive als auch negative Konsequenzen haben (Haslam & Kvaale, 2015).\n",
      "Das “stigma asymmetry model” kommt zu einem ähnlichen Ergebnis. Die biologische Erklärung, in diesem Fall von Übergewicht, kann sowohl negative Vorurteile abbauen, als auch gewisse Vorurteile stärken (Hoyt et al., 2017).\n",
      "Bei der Wirkung einer biologischen Erklärung auf die Wahrnehmung von ADHS konnte festgestellt werden, dass sich ein verstärkter Behandlungspessimus einstellte. Die Feststellung differenziert sich in zwei Befunde, zum einen wird der medikamentösen Behandlung eine größere Effektivität zugeschrieben, zum anderen reduziert sich die wahrgenommene Effektivität einer psychotherapeutischen Behandlung (Lebowitz et al., 2016). Außerdem reduziert sich der Wunsch nach sozialer Distanz, was damit in Verbindung gebracht werden kann, dass Menschen mit kognitiven Defiziten selten als bedrohlich und gefährlich stereotypisiert sind. Bei ADHS überwiegen vor allem Vorurteile in Bezug auf die eigene Verantwortlichkeit für die Probleme. Gerade diese Sichtweise wird durch die biologische Erklärung unterminiert, weshalb es ein effektiver Weg sein kann, durch die biologische Erklärung Vorurteile abzubauen (Sadler et al., 2012).\n",
      "Die Studie versucht zum einen den Zusammenhang von biologischer Attribution und ADHS-Stigma zu evaluieren. Darüber hinaus soll herausgefunden werden, welchen Einfluss ein spezielles Framing der biologischen Ursache auf die Stigmatisierung hat. Dafür wurden zwei fiktive Artikel entworfen. Ein Artikel verweist auf eine eindeutig biologische Ursache, der andere Artikel betont ein Zusammenspiel von biologischen und Umweltfaktoren, da vermutet wird, dass ein interaktionistischer Blick eine essentialistische Sichtweise untergräbt und dadurch das negative Stigma reduziert (Walker & Read, 2002). Insgesamt wird hypothetisch angenommen, dass der Artikel zum biologischen Determinismus die Stigmatisierung sowohl reduziert als auch steigert. Für den interaktionistischen Artikel wird hypothetisiert, dass die biologische Sichtweise die Beschuldigung gegenüber den betroffenen Personen reduziert und die Betonung der Umweltfaktoren den Behandlungsoptimismus stärkt (Ching & Ma, 2021).\n",

Auf Basis der Attributionstheorie stellt sich die Frage, ob durch die ursächliche Erklärung von ADHS das Stigma verringert werden kann? Welchen Einfluss hat das Framing von ADHS auf die Stigmatisierung? \\nDie Attributionstheorie nimmt die wahrgenommene Kausalität, beispielsweise zwischen zwei Merkmalen, in den Blick (Weiner, 1995). Ein soziales Stigma meint eine negative Beurteilung gegenüber einem Individuum (Jones et al., 1984). Die Attributionstheorie untersucht den Ursprung sozialer Stigmata. Es wird geschaut, welche wahrgenommenen Kausalitäten gemäß der Attributionstheorie zu der Stigmatisierung führen. Das Stigma wird beispielsweise hinsichtlich der Kontrollierbarkeit untersucht. Wird ein Verhalten stigmatisiert, das als biologisch determiniert - also als wenig bis gar nicht kontrollierbar - wahrgenommen wird, kommt es zu einer geringeren Verurteilung (Corrigan, 2000). Andererseits stützt es die individuelle Wahrnehmung einer kategorischen Differenz zwischen sich und der stigmatisierten Person und festigt dadurch Stereotype (Dar-Nimrod & Heine, 2006; Haslam & Levy, 2006).\\nIn einer Meta-Analyse (Kvaale et. al., 2013) konnte herausgefunden werden, dass durch eine biologische Erklärung mentaler Krankheit die Personen weniger für ihre Problem verantwortlich gemacht werden, es aber die wahrgenommene Gefährlichkeit und Unberechenbarkeit und die Distanz zu den Personen erhöht und verstärkt davon ausgegangen wird, dass sich die mentale Störung nicht behandeln lässt. Das Stigma ist multidimensional, weshalb die biologische Erklärung in Bezug auf die verschiedenen Dimensionen unterschiedlich interpretiert wird. So kann die biologische Erklärung sowohl positive als auch negative Konsequenzen haben (Haslam & Kvaale, 2015).\\nDas “stigma asymmetry model” kommt zu einem ähnlichen Ergebnis. Die biologische Erklärung, in diesem Fall von Übergewicht, kann sowohl negative Vorurteile abbauen, als auch gewisse Vorurteile stärken (Hoyt et al., 2017).\\nBei der Wirkung einer biologischen Erklärung auf die Wahrnehmung von ADHS konnte festgestellt werden, dass sich ein verstärkter Behandlungspessimus einstellte. Die Feststellung differenziert sich in zwei Befunde, zum einen wird der medikamentösen Behandlung eine größere Effektivität zugeschrieben, zum anderen reduziert sich die wahrgenommene Effektivität einer psychotherapeutischen Behandlung (Lebowitz et al., 2016). Außerdem reduziert sich der Wunsch nach sozialer Distanz, was damit in Verbindung gebracht werden kann, dass Menschen mit kognitiven Defiziten selten als bedrohlich und gefährlich stereotypisiert sind. Bei ADHS überwiegen vor allem Vorurteile in Bezug auf die eigene Verantwortlichkeit für die Probleme. Gerade diese Sichtweise wird durch die biologische Erklärung unterminiert, weshalb es ein effektiver Weg sein kann, durch die biologische Erklärung Vorurteile abzubauen (Sadler et al., 2012).\\nDie Studie versucht zum einen den Zusammenhang von biologischer Attribution und ADHS-Stigma zu evaluieren. Darüber hinaus soll herausgefunden werden, welchen Einfluss ein spezielles Framing der biologischen Ursache auf die Stigmatisierung hat. Dafür wurden zwei fiktive Artikel entworfen. Ein Artikel verweist auf eine eindeutig biologische Ursache, der andere Artikel betont ein Zusammenspiel von biologischen und Umweltfaktoren, da vermutet wird, dass ein interaktionistischer Blick eine essentialistische Sichtweise untergräbt und dadurch das negative Stigma reduziert (Walker & Read, 2002). Insgesamt wird hypothetisch angenommen, dass der Artikel zum biologischen Determinismus die Stigmatisierung sowohl reduziert als auch steigert. Für den interaktionistischen Artikel wird hypothetisiert, dass die biologische Sichtweise die Beschuldigung gegenüber den betroffenen Personen reduziert und die Betonung der Umweltfaktoren den Behandlungsoptimismus stärkt (Ching & Ma, 2021).\\n\\nLiteraturverzeichnis\\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

      "In einer Studie untersuchen Ching und Ma (2021) den Einfluss von Erklärungen zum Ursprung der Aufmerksamkeits-Defizit-Hyperaktivitäts-Störung, kurz ADHS, auf die Stigmatisierung der Störung. ADHS ist eine weit verbreitete Verhaltensstörung mit einer weltweiten Prävalenz von 5,29% (Polanczky et al., 2007). Die Störung ist durch Unaufmerksamkeit, Hyperaktivität und Impulsivität gekennzeichnet (American Psychiatric Association, 1994).\n",
      "Es können diverse Stigmatisierungen gegenüber Menschen mit ADHS festgestellt werden. ADHS-Diagnostizierte sind mit einer höheren Gefährlichkeit (Pescosolido et al., 2007) und einem geringeren Bildungserfolg assoziiert (Eisenberg & Schneider, 2007). Zudem besteht gegenüber der Gruppe eine soziale Unerwünschtheit (Canu et al., 2008).

      "Zusammenfassung:\n",
      "Zur Untersuchung der Attributionstheorie nutzten Ching und Ma (2021) ein experimentelles Forschungsdesign, um festzustellen, ob sich besseres Wissen über die Ursachen von ADHS auf negative Stigmatisierung auswirkt.\n",
      "Die Gelegenheitsstichprobe von Ching und Ma (2021) setzte sich aus 81 Studenten und 93 Studentinnen chinesischer Ethnizität der Universität in Macau zusammen. Die 174 Studierenden, von denen keiner eine ADHS-Diagnose hatte, kamen aus unterschiedlichen Fachbereichen. Die Teilnehmenden wurden randomisiert in drei gleiche Gruppen aufgeteilt, denen als unabhängige Variable unterschiedliche fiktive Texte über die Ursache von ADHS vorgelegt wurden. Die erste Experimentalgruppe erhielt einen Text über biologische Faktoren, die zweite einen Text über die Interaktion aus biologischen und Umweltfaktoren und die Kontrollgruppe Text über präventive Gesundheitsmaßnahmen.\n",

      "In einer Studie untersuchen Ching und Ma (2021) den Einfluss von Erklärungen zum Ursprung der Aufmerksamkeits-Defizit-Hyperaktivitäts-Störung, kurz ADHS, auf die Stigmatisierung der Störung. ADHS ist eine weit verbreitete Verhaltensstörung mit einer weltweiten Prävalenz von 5,29% (Polanczky et al., 2007). Die Störung ist durch Unaufmerksamkeit, Hyperaktivität und Impulsivität gekennzeichnet (American Psychiatric Association, 1994).\n",
      "Es können diverse Stigmatisierungen gegenüber Menschen mit ADHS festgestellt werden. ADHS-Diagnostizierte sind mit einer höheren Gefährlichkeit (Pescosolido et al., 2007) und einem geringeren Bildungserfolg assoziiert (Eisenberg & Schneider, 2007). Zudem besteht gegenüber der Gruppe eine soziale Unerwünschtheit (Canu et al., 2008). Auf Basis der Attributionstheorie stellt sich die Frage, ob durch die ursächliche Erklärung von ADHS das Stigma verringert werden kann? Welchen Einfluss hat das Framing von ADHS auf die Stigmatisierung? \n",
      "Die Attributionstheorie nimmt die wahrgenommene Kausalität, beispielsweise zwischen zwei Merkmalen, in den Blick (Weiner, 1995). Ein soziales Stigma meint eine negative Beurteilung gegenüber einem Individuum (Jones et al., 1984). Die Attributionstheorie untersucht den Ursprung sozialer Stigmata. Es wird geschaut, welche wahrgenommenen Kausalitäten gemäß der Attributionstheorie zu der Stigmatisierung führen. Das Stigma wird beispielsweise hinsichtlich der Kontrollierbarkeit untersucht. Wird ein Verhalten stigmatisiert, das als biologisch determiniert - also als wenig bis gar nicht kontrollierbar - wahrgenommen wird, kommt es zu einer geringeren Verurteilung (Corrigan, 2000). Andererseits stützt es die individuelle Wahrnehmung einer kategorischen Differenz zwischen sich und der stigmatisierten Person und festigt dadurch Stereotype (Dar-Nimrod & Heine, 2006; Haslam & Levy, 2006).\n",
      "In einer Meta-Analyse (Kvaale et. al., 2013) konnte herausgefunden werden, dass durch eine biologische Erklärung mentaler Krankheit die Personen weniger für ihre Problem verantwortlich gemacht werden, es aber die wahrgenommene Gefährlichkeit und Unberechenbarkeit und die Distanz zu den Personen erhöht und verstärkt davon ausgegangen wird, dass sich die mentale Störung nicht behandeln lässt. Das Stigma ist multidimensional, weshalb die biologische Erklärung in Bezug auf die verschiedenen Dimensionen unterschiedlich interpretiert wird. So kann die biologische Erklärung sowohl positive als auch negative Konsequenzen haben (Haslam & Kvaale, 2015).\n",
      "Das “stigma asymmetry model” kommt zu einem ähnlichen Ergebnis. Die biologische Erklärung, in diesem Fall von Übergewicht, kann sowohl negative Vorurteile abbauen, als auch gewisse Vorurteile stärken (Hoyt et al., 2017).\n",
      "Bei der Wirkung einer biologischen Erklärung auf die Wahrnehmung von ADHS konnte festgestellt werden, dass sich ein verstärkter Behandlungspessimus einstellte. Die Feststellung differenziert sich in zwei Befunde, zum einen wird der medikamentösen Behandlung eine größere Effektivität zugeschrieben, zum anderen reduziert sich die wahrgenommene Effektivität einer psychotherapeutischen Behandlung (Lebowitz et al., 2016). Außerdem reduziert sich der Wunsch nach sozialer Distanz, was damit in Verbindung gebracht werden kann, dass Menschen mit kognitiven Defiziten selten als bedrohlich und gefährlich stereotypisiert sind. Bei ADHS überwiegen vor allem Vorurteile in Bezug auf die eigene Verantwortlichkeit für die Probleme. Gerade diese Sichtweise wird durch die biologische Erklärung unterminiert, weshalb es ein effektiver Weg sein kann, durch die biologische Erklärung Vorurteile abzubauen (Sadler et al., 2012).\n",
      "Die Studie versucht zum einen den Zusammenhang von biologischer Attribution und ADHS-Stigma zu evaluieren. Darüber hinaus soll herausgefunden werden, welchen Einfluss ein spezielles Framing der biologischen Ursache auf die Stigmatisierung hat. Dafür wurden zwei fiktive Artikel entworfen. Ein Artikel verweist auf eine eindeutig biologische Ursache, der andere Artikel betont ein Zusammenspiel von biologischen und Umweltfaktoren, da vermutet wird, dass ein interaktionistischer Blick eine essentialistische Sichtweise untergräbt und dadurch das negative Stigma reduziert (Walker & Read, 2002). Insgesamt wird hypothetisch angenommen, dass der Artikel zum biologischen Determinismus die Stigmatisierung sowohl reduziert als auch steigert. Für den interaktionistischen Artikel wird hypothetisiert, dass die biologische Sichtweise die Beschuldigung gegenüber den betroffenen Personen reduziert und die Betonung der Umweltfaktoren den Behandlungsoptimismus stärkt (Ching & Ma, 2021).\n",

      "Das “stigma asymmetry model” kommt zu einem ähnlichen Ergebnis. Die biologische Erklärung, in diesem Fall von Übergewicht, kann sowohl negative Vorurteile abbauen, als auch gewisse Vorurteile stärken (Hoyt et al., 2017).\n",
      "Bei der Wirkung einer biologischen Erklärung auf die Wahrnehmung von ADHS konnte festgestellt werden, dass sich ein verstärkter Behandlungspessimus einstellte. Die Feststellung differenziert sich in zwei Befunde, zum einen wird der medikamentösen Behandlung eine größere Effektivität zugeschrieben, zum anderen reduziert sich die wahrgenommene Effektivität einer psychotherapeutischen Behandlung (Lebowitz et al., 2016). Außerdem reduziert sich der Wunsch nach sozialer Distanz, was damit in Verbindung gebracht werden kann, dass Menschen mit kognitiven Defiziten selten als bedrohlich und gefährlich stereotypisiert sind. Bei ADHS überwiegen vor allem Vorurteile in Bezug auf die eigene Verantwortlichkeit für die Probleme. Gerade diese Sichtweise wird durch die biologische Erklärung unterminiert, weshalb es ein effektiver Weg sein kann, durch die biologische Erklärung Vorurteile abzubauen (Sadler et al., 2012).\n",
      "Die Studie versucht zum einen den Zusammenhang von biologischer Attribution und ADHS-Stigma zu evaluieren. Darüber hinaus soll herausgefunden werden, welchen Einfluss ein spezielles Framing der biologischen Ursache auf die Stigmatisierung hat. Dafür wurden zwei fiktive Artikel entworfen. Ein Artikel verweist auf eine eindeutig biologische Ursache, der andere Artikel betont ein Zusammenspiel von biologischen und Umweltfaktoren, da vermutet wird, dass ein interaktionistischer Blick eine essentialistische Sichtweise untergräbt und dadurch das negative Stigma reduziert (Walker & Read, 2002). Insgesamt wird hypothetisch angenommen, dass der Artikel zum biologischen Determinismus die Stigmatisierung sowohl reduziert als auch steigert. Für den interaktionistischen Artikel wird hypothetisiert, dass die biologische Sichtweise die Beschuldigung gegenüber den betroffenen Personen reduziert und die Betonung der Umweltfaktoren den Behandlungsoptimismus stärkt (Ching & Ma, 2021).\n",

Eine Varianzanalyse (ANOVA) zeigte, dass es keine signifikanten Unterschiede im Alter der Teilnehmer je nach Bedingung gab. Chi-Quadrat-Tests für die Unabhängigkeit ergaben, dass es keine signifikanten Unterschiede im Geschlecht der Teilnehmer je nach Bedingung gab und keine signifikanten Unterschiede in den Studienfächern der Teilnehmer je nach Bedingung. Es gab auch keine signifikanten Unterschiede in der Anzahl der Personen, die sie kannten und die ADHS hatten, zwischen den drei Bedingungen. Im Durchschnitt beantworteten die Teilnehmer 90 % der Fragen, die ihr Verständnis der Textpassagen beurteilten, richtig, und es gab keine signifikanten Gruppenunterschiede. Diese Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass die zufällige Zuordnung der Teilnehmer zu den verschiedenen Bedingungen wie geplant funktioniert hat. Die Daten wurden auch auf Schiefe (<|3,0|) und Wölbung (<|10,0|; Weston & Gore, 2006) geprüft. Die absoluten Werte der standardisierten Residuen erfüllten diese Kriterien, so dass keine Ausreißer gefunden wurden. Boxplots für alle abhängigen Variablen zeigten, dass es keine Ausreißer gab.

      "In einer Studie untersuchen Ching und Ma (2021) den Einfluss von Erklärungen zum Ursprung der Aufmerksamkeits-Defizit-Hyperaktivitäts-Störung, kurz ADHS, auf die Stigmatisierung der Störung. ADHS ist eine weit verbreitete Verhaltensstörung mit einer weltweiten Prävalenz von 5,29% (Polanczky et al., 2007). Die Störung ist durch Unaufmerksamkeit, Hyperaktivität und Impulsivität gekennzeichnet (American Psychiatric Association, 1994).\n",
      "Es können diverse Stigmatisierungen gegenüber Menschen mit ADHS festgestellt werden. ADHS-Diagnostizierte sind mit einer höheren Gefährlichkeit (Pescosolido et al., 2007) und einem geringeren Bildungserfolg assoziiert (Eisenberg & Schneider, 2007). Zudem besteht gegenüber der Gruppe eine soziale Unerwünschtheit (Canu et al., 2008). Auf Basis der Attributionstheorie stellt sich die Frage, ob durch die ursächliche Erklärung von ADHS das Stigma verringert werden kann? Welchen Einfluss hat das Framing von ADHS auf die Stigmatisierung? \n",
      "Die Attributionstheorie nimmt die wahrgenommene Kausalität, beispielsweise zwischen zwei Merkmalen, in den Blick (Weiner, 1995). Ein soziales Stigma meint eine negative Beurteilung gegenüber einem Individuum (Jones et al., 1984). Die Attributionstheorie untersucht den Ursprung sozialer Stigmata. Es wird geschaut, welche wahrgenommenen Kausalitäten gemäß der Attributionstheorie zu der Stigmatisierung führen. Das Stigma wird beispielsweise hinsichtlich der Kontrollierbarkeit untersucht. Wird ein Verhalten stigmatisiert, das als biologisch determiniert - also als wenig bis gar nicht kontrollierbar - wahrgenommen wird, kommt es zu einer geringeren Verurteilung (Corrigan, 2000). Andererseits stützt es die individuelle Wahrnehmung einer kategorischen Differenz zwischen sich und der stigmatisierten Person und festigt dadurch Stereotype (Dar-Nimrod & Heine, 2006; Haslam & Levy, 2006).\n",
      "In einer Meta-Analyse (Kvaale et. al., 2013) konnte herausgefunden werden, dass durch eine biologische Erklärung mentaler Krankheit die Personen weniger für ihre Problem verantwortlich gemacht werden, es aber die wahrgenommene Gefährlichkeit und Unberechenbarkeit und die Distanz zu den Personen erhöht und verstärkt davon ausgegangen wird, dass sich die mentale Störung nicht behandeln lässt. Das Stigma ist multidimensional, weshalb die biologische Erklärung in Bezug auf die verschiedenen Dimensionen unterschiedlich interpretiert wird. So kann die biologische Erklärung sowohl positive als auch negative Konsequenzen haben (Haslam & Kvaale, 2015).\n",
      "Das “stigma asymmetry model” kommt zu einem ähnlichen Ergebnis. Die biologische Erklärung, in diesem Fall von Übergewicht, kann sowohl negative Vorurteile abbauen, als auch gewisse Vorurteile stärken (Hoyt et al., 2017).\n",
      "Bei der Wirkung einer biologischen Erklärung auf die Wahrnehmung von ADHS konnte festgestellt werden, dass sich ein verstärkter Behandlungspessimus einstellte. Die Feststellung differenziert sich in zwei Befunde, zum einen wird der medikamentösen Behandlung eine größere Effektivität zugeschrieben, zum anderen reduziert sich die wahrgenommene Effektivität einer psychotherapeutischen Behandlung (Lebowitz et al., 2016). Außerdem reduziert sich der Wunsch nach sozialer Distanz, was damit in Verbindung gebracht werden kann, dass Menschen mit kognitiven Defiziten selten als bedrohlich und gefährlich stereotypisiert sind. Bei ADHS überwiegen vor allem Vorurteile in Bezug auf die eigene Verantwortlichkeit für die Probleme. Gerade diese Sichtweise wird durch die biologische Erklärung unterminiert, weshalb es ein effektiver Weg sein kann, durch die biologische Erklärung Vorurteile abzubauen (Sadler et al., 2012).\n",
      "Die Studie versucht zum einen den Zusammenhang von biologischer Attribution und ADHS-Stigma zu evaluieren. Darüber hinaus soll herausgefunden werden, welchen Einfluss ein spezielles Framing der biologischen Ursache auf die Stigmatisierung hat. Dafür wurden zwei fiktive Artikel entworfen. Ein Artikel verweist auf eine eindeutig biologische Ursache, der andere Artikel betont ein Zusammenspiel von biologischen und Umweltfaktoren, da vermutet wird, dass ein interaktionistischer Blick eine essentialistische Sichtweise untergräbt und dadurch das negative Stigma reduziert (Walker & Read, 2002). Insgesamt wird hypothetisch angenommen, dass der Artikel zum biologischen Determinismus die Stigmatisierung sowohl reduziert als auch steigert. Für den interaktionistischen Artikel wird hypothetisiert, dass die biologische Sichtweise die Beschuldigung gegenüber den betroffenen Personen reduziert und die Betonung der Umweltfaktoren den Behandlungsoptimismus stärkt (Ching & Ma, 2021).\n",

Nicht-erwachsene ADHS-Betroffene sehen sich im Vergleich zu Kindern ohne ADHS einer Reihe Stigmata ausgesetzt, wie z.B. geringerer sozialer Erwünschtheit (Canu et al., 2008), schlechtere Einschätzungen der schulischen Kompetenz durch Lehrkräfte oder der eigenen Eltern (Eisenberg & Schneider, 2007) . Um einen Weg zu finden, diese Stigmatisierung, die durch alle Altersgruppen hinweg vorhanden zu sein scheint (Ching & Ma, 2021), zu verringern, untersuchten Ching und Ma (2021) in einer experimentellen Studie an 174 Studierenden die Auswirkungen unterschiedlicher Darstellungen der Ursachen von ADHS auf die Stigmatisierung von Menschen mit ADHS.\n",
