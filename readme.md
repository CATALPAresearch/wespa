# WESPA - Web Service for Etherpad Analysis

WESPA is a Python-based tool and web service tailored for analysis of Etherpad collaboration data. It supports full extraction of changesets, text reconstruction, and multi-dimensional analysis of co-editing behavior and linguistic patterns.

## Key Features

**Analysis**

- extracts etherpad changesets
- reconstructs text from etherpad changesets
- computes measures about what pad authors edited text writen by another author
- constructs a network graph of bidirection co-editing activities
- linguistic analysis of texts
- processes data of multiple etherpads from multiple groups of authors

**Analytics Engine**

- Can be run as a webservice

## Roadmap

**Next steps**

- create versions of the collaboratively created text documents
- handle peer review data
- setup poetry instead of pip
- add code comments to all classes and functions
- finish scheduler and API in app.py
- load data from postgres in addition to csv
- store results in a resultsstore db, also on postgres
  - store data per user and group, considering course, course-task/pad, and time frames like weeks/days
    - use existing descriptive features here
- handle other moodle activities?

## How To Use

**Prerequisits**

- Python 3.11.6
- poetry

```bash
# 1. Clone  the repository
$ git clone git@github.com:catalparesearch/wespa.git

# 2. Run
$ poetry install

# 3. Run tests
python -m unittest tests.test.TestClass

```

**How to use WESPA for analysis**

- The data folder contains different database dumps of the Polaris server
- Open the analysis.ipynb and either
  - run the processing form step 1 to step 5 or
  - run the "All at once" blocks at the lower part of the file
- Find the results in the output folder

**How to use WESPA's Analytics Engine as a webservice**

WESPA can be used an analytics engine to process data from a etherpad database and sending the results on request. Run `poetry run python3.12 src/app.py`

## Getting Started with Development

1. Get data and run the analysis.ipnyb
2. Inspect the the extract\*.py files in the src folder
3. tba.
